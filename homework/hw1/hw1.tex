Feel free to work with other students, but make sure you write up the homework
and code on your own (no copying homework \textit{or} code; no pair programming).
Feel free to ask students or instructors for help debugging code or whatever else,
though.\\

part of the homework. Please create a repository on Github to hold all your
code and include your Github account username as part of the answer to the
coding problems.
